<div id='c'><font size='5'><b>General Relativity</b></font>
<p align='justify'>General relativity is a theory of gravitation
developed by Einstein in the years 1907-1915. The development of
general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which
the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational
field (for example when standing on the surface of the Earth) are 
physically identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial
motion; an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects
move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this
being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical
mechanics.</p></div>
