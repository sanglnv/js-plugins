<h2>Limericks by Edward Lear</h2><b>

<span id='h1'>Beard Limerick</span> |
<span id='h2'>Bee Limerick</span> |
<span id='h3'>Chin Limerick</span></b><br /><br />

<div id='l1'>There was an Old Man with a beard,<br />
Who said, 'It is just as I feared!<br />
Two Owls and a Hen,<br />
Four Larks and a Wren,<br />
Have all built their nests in my beard!'</div>

<div id='l2'>There was an Old Man in a tree,<br />
Who was horribly bored by a Bee;<br />
When they said, 'Does it buzz?'<br />
He replied, 'Yes, it does!'<br />
'It's a regular brute of a Bee!'</div>

<div id='l3'>There was a Young Lady whose chin,<br />
Resembled the point of a pin;<br />
So she had it made sharp,<br />
And purchased a harp,<br />
And played several tunes with her chin.</div>
